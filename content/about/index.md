I have a passion for programming and am eager to learn more about ðŸ’»web development and ðŸŽ®game designing. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various hobbies such as gym training, building plastic models, and enjoying rhythm games. Whenever possible, I love to find a beautiful afternoon, and record my model building process while having some jazzy rhythm aside.
